# FileRandomizer
Basic utility to randomize MP3 files for small devices (Qt version)

The idea came up 'cause back in the days most of MP3 players didn't provide the random access to the files in the begining. But also, some times you like to play in the same order for a certain period of time. Till you and the kids get along with the songs but not being the same artist all the time.

I don't know... I just came to this.
